## Person of Interest

Let's define the criteria of the Person of Interest or POI.

* Indicted (charge with a crime).
* Settled (paid fine) without admitting guilt.

## Accuracy vs Training Set Size

The more training data we have, the more accurate our classifier can be. More data even always be better than having a fine tuned parameters.

Here's the en example of the corellation of dataset size and the accuracy of the classifier:

## Types Data

Here are some types of data that we'll be dealing with:

* Numerical: numerical values (numbers) e.g. salary info.
* Categorical: limited number of discrete values (category) e.g. job title
* Time series: temporal value (date, timestamp) e.g. email timestamp
* Text: words e.g. email content, email recipients
