## SVM Summary

* SVM is a supervised learning model.
* It takes an input of data with two categories and create a line that separate these two categories.
* It find the maximum distance or margin between the line and the nearest point from both of the categories.
* It puts the correctness of the classification first before trying to maximize the margin.
* SVM can solve not only the linearly separated classes, but the non-linear classes too.
* SVM tackle the non-linearly separated classes by using the kernel trick. It transform the low dimensional inputs into a higher dimensional inputs that are linearly separarable.
* Sklearn provided several built-in kernel that we can use with SVM SVC: `linear`, `poly`, `rbf` (default value), `sigmoid`, `precomputed`.

## Terrain Classifier with Naive Bayes

### Create and Train a SVM Classifier

We can use the [SVM classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) easily with scikit-learn:

```py
from sklearn import svm

# Create and train the classifier.
classifier = svm.SVC(kernel = "linear")
classifier.fit(features_train, labels_train)

# Predict the output labels.
clasifier.predict(features_test)
```

### Run the Classifier

Type the following command on your terminal to run the terrain classifier:

```shell
# Go to the project directory.
$ cd /path/to/intro-to-machine-learning

# And run it with Python
$ python svm/terrain_classifier
```

### Terrain Classifier Result

The result from using the SVM classifier to predict the vehicle's speed given a terrain condition.
